## Background

This repository is to implement the Floyd-Warshall algorithm in Python to find the shortest distances between vertices. The function is written in the recursive method as part of solving the Mid-Module Assignment of the Software Development in Practice module at the University of Liverpool. There are also performance test codes that are performed on pre-defined data sets using Python built-in packages Unit Test and cProfile. The application was developed using PyCharm Community Edition IDE.

<a name="usage"/>

## Usage

Type the following command to execute the program:

    python test_recursive.py

<a name="performance_test"/>

## Performance Test

<a name="unittest"/>

### Unit Test

To perform Unit Test for the data samples in test_samples.py file, type the following command in the IDE terminal or run the code directly:

    python -m unittest tests/unit_test_recursive.py

<a name="cprofile"/>

### cProfile (Pefromance Test)

To test the performance of recursive and imperative version of Floyd-Warshall functions, type the following command in the IDE terminal or run the code directly:

    python -m cProfile tests/performance_test_recursive.py
